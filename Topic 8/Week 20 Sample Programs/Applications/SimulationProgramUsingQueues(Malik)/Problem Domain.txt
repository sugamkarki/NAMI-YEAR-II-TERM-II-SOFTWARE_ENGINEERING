Problem:
The manager of a local movie theater is hearing complaints from customers about the length of time they have to wait in line to buy tickets. The theater currently has only one cashier. Another theater is preparing to open in the neighbourhood, and the manager is afraid of losing customers. The manager wants to hire enough cahiers so that a customer does not have to wait too long to buy a ticket, but does not want to hire extra cashiers on a trial basis and potentially waste time and money. One thing the manager would like to know is the average time a customer has to wait for service. The manager wants someone to write a program to simulate the behavior of the theater.
